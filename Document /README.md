                                        ABSTRACT
                                        
Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a browser based system that is designed to store, 
process, retrieve and analyze information concerned with the administrative and inventory 
management within a blood bank. This project aims at maintaining all the information 
pertaining to blood donors, different blood groups available in each blood bank and help them 
manage in a better way. Aim is to provide transparency in this field, make the process of 
obtaining blood from a blood bank hassle free and corruption free and make the system of 
blood bank management effective. Our client is not interested in blood stocking instead we are 
stocking blood donors information. The donors who are interested in donating blood has to 
register in the database. There is no storage of blood so no complications in the project. The 
software is fully integrated with CRM (customer relationship management) as well as CMS 
(content management system) solution. It is developed in a manner that is easily manageable, 
time saving and relieving one from manual works. The requirement of the blood has to be 
requested and we supply the information of the donor. The donors can update their status 
whether they are available or not.

Blood donation is required during an organ transplant, accidents, cancer treatment etc. For 
blood donation, one needs to check for a donation camp or needs to visit blood bank. The 
Manual Blood donation system has many disadvantages which includes, it is too time 
consuming, often leads to error prone results, consumes lot of manpower, lacks donor 
information, retrieval of data takes a lot of time, percentage of accuracy is less. In the time of 
emergency, it becomes difficult to approach the right donor. Rare blood groups are not 
available all the time at all blood banks and recipients find difficulties to track the right blood 
donor. There are many blood donation management systems, but these systems only maintain 
the information of blood banks and donors. This online blood donation management system 
maintains the list of blood donors and also helps the recipients to track and search the right 
donor easily. It has two modules namely Admin and User. Admin can add hospitals having 
blood banks and can also add various blood donation camps.
He/she can also view the list of donors of a particular area with proper Blood cross match. 
He/she can also check for blood requests and in case of emergency he/she can send notifications 
to blood donors as per the requirements. Users can register and make a request. Donors can 
check for Blood camps and hospitals for blood donation.

                            1.1 Problem Definition:
                            
Entering the details about the blood groups, members, addresses etc. And tracking the database 
is complicated when the details are maintained manually. This makes the maintenance of 
schedule erroneous.
Nowadays, people who need blood are increasing day by day. Being popular people are trying 
to communicate with this blood bank when they need blood in difficulty. But their way of 
communication is telephonic that's why people can't easily communicate with them. If the 
blood group isn't available at the blood bank then the manual transmission might prove in vain.
There is no information regarding the blood donation or managing programs available on any 
of the portal. This manually system raises the cost and time required to a considerable extent.
Also, people don't have any idea about blood donation how it works.

1.2 Objective of Project:

This is a web application allows you to access the whole information about Blood Bank 
Management Software, readily scalable and adaptable to meet the complex need of Blood 
Banks Who are Key Facilitator for the Healthcare Sector, it also supports all the functionalities 
of Blood Bank. After defining the problems existing the current systems, the objectives of 
blood bank management system are :
• Provide a report that can be generated of donors, seekers, total consumption of the blood 
units so that costs, records and counts are maintained precisely.
• To help raise awareness in the community about blood donation and make some blood 
donation events or campaigns for the public 
• To allow the public and organization to make online reservations on the day and session 
that they want to make blood donation.
• To provide authentic and authorized features to the current system where private and 
confidential data can only be viewed by authorized users.
• To make a valid informative portal about blood donation & managing systems

1.3 Limitations of Project:

• With the manual system, there are problems in managing the donor records. The records 
of the donor might not be kept safely and there might be missing of donor's records due 
to human error or disasters.
• It is not that people don't want to donate blood but their limited knowledge they don't 
have any idea of blood donation.
• The way of communication is telephonic which is sometimes unreachable & makes it 
unbearable.
• Being careless the confidential data may be handed on to unauthorized users. * No valid 
• information regarding the blood donation or managing programs available on any of 
the portals
