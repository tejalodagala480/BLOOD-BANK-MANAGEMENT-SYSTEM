This project aims at maintaining all the information\npertaining to blood donors, different blood groups available in each blood bank and help them\nmanage in a better way. Aim is to provide transparency in this field, make the process of\nobtaining blood from a blood bank hassle free and corruption free and make the system of\nblood bank management effective. Our client is not interested in blood stocking instead we are\nstocking blood donors information. The donors who are interested in donating blood has to\nregister in the database. There is no storage of blood so no complications in the project. The\nsoftware is fully integrated with CRM (customer relationship management) as well as CMS\n(content management system) solution. It is developed in a manner that is easily manageable,\ntime saving and relieving one from manual works. The requirement of the blood has to be\nrequested and we supply the information of the donor. The donors can update their status\nwhether they are available or not.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Blood donation is required during an organ transplant, accidents, cancer treatment etc. For\nblood donation, one needs to check for a donation camp or needs to visit blood bank. The\nManual Blood donation system has many disadvantages which includes, it is too time\nconsuming, often leads to error prone results, consumes lot of manpower, lacks donor\ninformation, retrieval of data takes a lot of time, percentage of accuracy is less. In the time of\nemergency, it becomes difficult to approach the right donor. Rare blood groups are not\navailable all the time at all blood banks and recipients find difficulties to track the right blood\ndonor. There are many blood donation management systems, but these systems only maintain\nthe information of blood banks and donors. This online blood donation management system\nmaintains the list of blood donors and also helps the recipients to track and search the right\ndonor easily. It has two modules namely Admin and User. Admin can add hospitals having\nblood banks and can also add various blood donation camps.\nHe/she can also view the list of donors of a particular area with proper Blood cross match.\nHe/she can also check for blood requests and in case of emergency he/she can send notifications\nto blood donors as per the requirements. Users can register and make a request. Donors can\ncheck for Blood camps and hospitals for blood donation.</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"                        1.1 Problem Definition:\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>                        1.1 Problem Definition:\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Entering the details about the blood groups, members, addresses etc. And tracking the database\nis complicated when the details are maintained manually. This makes the maintenance of\nschedule erroneous.\nNowadays, people who need blood are increasing day by day. Being popular people are trying\nto communicate with this blood bank when they need blood in difficulty. But their way of\ncommunication is telephonic that's why people can't easily communicate with them. If the\nblood group isn't available at the blood bank then the manual transmission might prove in vain.\nThere is no information regarding the blood donation or managing programs available on any\nof the portal. This manually system raises the cost and time required to a considerable extent.\nAlso, people don't have any idea about blood donation how it works.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">1.2 Objective of Project:</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This is a web application allows you to access the whole information about Blood Bank\nManagement Software, readily scalable and adaptable to meet the complex need of Blood\nBanks Who are Key Facilitator for the Healthcare Sector, it also supports all the functionalities\nof Blood Bank. After defining the problems existing the current systems, the objectives of\nblood bank management system are :\n• Provide a report that can be generated of donors, seekers, total consumption of the blood\nunits so that costs, records and counts are maintained precisely.\n• To help raise awareness in the community about blood donation and make some blood\ndonation events or campaigns for the public\n• To allow the public and organization to make online reservations on the day and session\nthat they want to make blood donation.\n• To provide authentic and authorized features to the current system where private and\nconfidential data can only be viewed by authorized users.\n• To make a valid informative portal about blood donation &amp; managing systems</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">1.3 Limitations of Project:</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">• With the manual system, there are problems in managing the donor records. The records\nof the donor might not be kept safely and there might be missing of donor's records due\nto human error or disasters.\n• It is not that people don't want to donate blood but their limited knowledge they don't\nhave any idea of blood donation.\n• The way of communication is telephonic which is sometimes unreachable &amp; makes it\nunbearable.\n• Being careless the confidential data may be handed on to unauthorized users. * No valid\n• information regarding the blood donation or managing programs available on any of\nthe portals</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"                              2.1 Survey Images:\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>                              2.1 Survey Images:\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286391-c3a4773a-ea74-4f0e-9c61-33d13ce134d0.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286391-c3a4773a-ea74-4f0e-9c61-33d13ce134d0.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286467-bf3e0149-ca21-4d57-a448-61991d551cdc.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286467-bf3e0149-ca21-4d57-a448-61991d551cdc.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286614-436329da-df7f-4a1f-a27c-958a59023935.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286614-436329da-df7f-4a1f-a27c-958a59023935.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286684-6afb75da-4cb1-4373-9ae3-854034638ca8.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286684-6afb75da-4cb1-4373-9ae3-854034638ca8.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286737-3fec9f35-ee68-442c-bb5a-f1a6949f1628.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286737-3fec9f35-ee68-442c-bb5a-f1a6949f1628.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286847-a84eb118-931e-4854-afec-cb4c8f5af3f3.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286847-a84eb118-931e-4854-afec-cb4c8f5af3f3.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286880-43ef37e8-5c2a-4a9b-bbcb-26bcba9c4245.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286880-43ef37e8-5c2a-4a9b-bbcb-26bcba9c4245.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286959-d5efed69-8341-4820-b752-2df7ee987ced.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272286959-d5efed69-8341-4820-b752-2df7ee987ced.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272287051-98730a7b-395e-4fbc-ad68-d30ed8e3efe1.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106898126/272287051-98730a7b-395e-4fbc-ad68-d30ed8e3efe1.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">2.2 Survey Report:</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Sno.
